# Training for job change - Software tester

I'm a "assembly manager" in retail industry. I'm in a moment in my life when I want to change my job to IT industry - my first step is to get job in software testing.
Why software testing? Because I have always used software to improve my work, make it easier or more automated and I most of the I used had defects which makes it not usable or hard to use at some point. I had situations in my worklife when buggy software has led to bad results in job - data lost, bad hydraulic calculations etc... 
This led me to opinion that defect-free software is very important nowadays, especially if it comes to healthcare, banking or firesafety.

This repository is created to document all my experience in software testing/QA throught reports/QA documents. 

Repository contains files:<br>
• <b>Test reports - app testing</b> - file contains reports created during testing desktop apps,
• <b>Test reports - web testing</b> - file contains reports created during testing webpages/web apps.
