# Training for job change - Software tester
<h3>
I'm a "assembly manager" in retail industry. I'm in a moment in my life when I want to change my job to IT industry - my first step is to get job in software testing.<br>
Why software testing? Because I have always used software to improve my work, make it easier or more automated and some of it had defects which makes it not usable or hard to use at some point. I had situations in my worklife when buggy software has led to bad results in job - data lost, bad hydraulic calculations etc... 
This led me to opinion that defect-free software is very important nowadays, especially if it comes to healthcare, banking or firesafety.

This repository is created to document all my experience in software testing/QA throught reports/QA documents.
